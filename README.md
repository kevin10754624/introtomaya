Intro to Maya

Hello MR. Romrell

This is my assingment for intro to maya, I did a project based on the videos and based on what i learned.
I've watched all the of 11 videos in Pluralsight, one by one undestarnding and trying it myself in MAYA

In the first video it explaining and showing how this tutorial is going to work, when you start MAYA you'll have many options but the things that stands out the most is the 3-D view thats where your models are going ot be created, you have a different type of menu bars firts you have the tools bar
