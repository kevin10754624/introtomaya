Intro to Maya

Hello MR. Romrell

This is my assingment for intro to maya, I did a project based on the videos and based on what i learned.
I've watched all the of 11 videos in Pluralsight, one by one undestarnding and trying it myself in MAYA

In the first video it explaining and showing how this tutorial is going to work, when you start MAYA you'll have many options but the things that stands out the most is the 3-D view thats where your models are going ot be created, you have a different type of menu bars you have a bar where you can make your the beginning of your desings like curves/surfaces ,polygon, and sculting, etc.
Then you have a menu bar where you can change and manage the way your mause works like, moving, rotating and selecting, yoiu will also have the channel box/layer where you can change and modify your tools.
Creating a MAYA project can be done in many ways, pressing Ctrl+N, or first you will want to set a maya project and saving it in a folder you'd like, any change you'd like to make to your projects you will want to save them pressing save.
When transforming a object you will want to use a lot your x, z, and y axis they will help you move, rotate, and change the way you view your project, it will also show in your channel box your axis and they way you change the way it will move and rotate. 
when creating a project, you will start by just creating a polygon like a cube, you can change the poits of intersectiog, faces, and edges, using your modeling tool kit it will show in the right and it will be called modeling tool and it will help you choose whether face, edge, and points, that's where youll have the option to. 
There are many tools and ways you can make projects, many tools that can help you make great things and creative projects, like animations, backgrounds, effects that will give your work a better look and a more sufisticated way to make your projects, with time and tehe wish to learn to use MAYA you will proceed and succed in this programm by making the most amazing projects and animations. 
It only takes time and the wish to learn, undestand, create, and practice your skills on the programm
